            <h2>Desenvolvedor</h2>
            <h3>ConcernedApe</h3>
            <img src="/images/Developed_By_Image.gif" width="240px">
            <p>ConcernedApe is Eric Barone, the creator and lead developer of Stardew Valley, as well as the name of the
                company he founded to continue game development. From 2012 to 2019, he was the sole developer of the
                game (except the multiplayer networking code in 1.3) and created all art, sound effects, and music. He
                currently resides in Seattle, Washington.

                In early 2019, ConcernedApe formed a small development team to continue updating the game. The 1.4
                update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe, Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian), and Alex Erlandson
                (a.k.a. zillix). The 1.5 update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe and Arthur Lee. See Stardew
                Valley for more info about the game's development.

                In late 2021 he announced ConcernedApe’s Haunted Chocolatier, a new game still in development.
                ConcernedApe began work on this game in late 2020 as the sole developer.</p>

            <h1>Stardew Valley</h1>
            <P>Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in
                Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can
                you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy.
                Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community
                center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of
                opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!
            </P>
